# Thomas Nguyen

**`Engineer of many trades`**

I'm an indie app developer, MEP engineer, prototyping engineer and content creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way, from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. 

I'm an indie app developer, working on projects that benefit tinkerers, engineers, and people that I know. Currently, I'm running the "[comfyStudio team](https://comfystudio.tech/)" with 2 projects: "[comfySSH](https://github.com/ThomasVuNguyen/ComfySSH_flutter)" and "[PipeLine](https://github.com/ThomasVuNguyen/PipeLine)". comfySSH is a cross-platform simple & customizable application to remotely control Raspberry Pi & components (also a great general Linux SSH tool) and PipeLine is a Revit/AutoCAD plug-in solution to help MEP Engineers automate their work & save time.

Moreover, I work as a Plumbing Engineer, working with AutoCAD & Revit, helping make buildings come true in Florida. This is where the majority of inspiration for "[PipeLine](https://github.com/ThomasVuNguyen/PipeLine)" is from.

As if two responsibilities aren't enough, I'm also working with "[Core Prototyping](https://www.coreprototyping.xyz/)" as an Electronic & Prototyping Engneer. Spawn from my passion for tinkering with Raspberry Pi & open-source projects and my professional experience working as a Manufacturing Engineer Intern at "[Sonoco](https://www.sonoco.com/)" and "[Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/)", this job turned an in-the-basement hobby into a career.

Lastly, I have a Youtube Channel "[Thomas The Maker](https://www.youtube.com/@thomasthemaker)", where I showcase unexplored Raspberry Pi projects with simple tutorials.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Forrest's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, unix, linux, theory. And all the while, teaching myself iOS development with a dream to build my own app, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Java. A desire that landed me a full-stack software engineering job upon graduation. However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - YouTube content creation. I eventually ended up quitting my software engineering job to pursue YouTube full-time, and that has been my focus ever since. But there's something that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of building my own app to pursue the safe route, a job. Now I've already taken the leap away from that safety net into this uncomfortable, unexplored world that it being a creator. And it worked out, but again, it became comfortable. It's easier to create a video than go out on a ledge and build my own product. I do have to eat, at the end of the day, but I think it's time. It's time to get uncomfortable again. I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of building my own app, my own product. And in order to do that, I'll be implmementing a few measures to streamline my YouTube content to focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in 2023 due to the measure I'm putting in place now until the end of 2022. Don't wait up, because I'm coming.
